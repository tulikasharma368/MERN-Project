- [Models link](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/YtPqZ1VogxGy1jzIDkzj)

# To add an empty folder/file to git - add .gitkeep file

# To easily generate .gitignore file use:
- [GitIgnore Generator](https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/)

# use a command like "touch constants.js index.js" on git bash to easily add files in a folder

# add '"type": "module"' in package.json to allow module imports

# use 'Nodemon' to develop the Node.js based application by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. Install it as a dev dependency, as it has no need in production. npm i -D nodemon
